# Record security review evidence

Read CLAUDE.md first. Resolve names before changes; list ambiguous candidates and ask the operator. Use dates and values supplied for this task, never the illustrative values below.

```bash
node scripts/practice.mjs security-review --name="backup restore" --date=2026-09-27 --evidence="REVIEW RECORD"
```

Read the result, then state the decision or outstanding field in plain words. Add `--json` for structured reads. For clinical notes use only the clinician's supplied words. Drafts stay in `drafts/`; do not send. Read `docs/compliance.md` for funding and privacy limits.
